This year's community survey is up! You can [go here to complete the 2020 Houston County Community Survey](https://s.surveyplanet.com/QmcPCMXf). Responses can be completely anonymous although you can optionally provide your email address if you'd like to see the results of the survey once it is complete.

Your opinion is vital to helping us determine the county's direction. Past surveys have told us to work harder towards improving broadband accessibility, an effort that is still underway, and also confirmed that the vast majority of the public is perfectly happy with the county's 4-day, 10-hour day work schedule.

We look forward to you sharing your opinions with us again this year. Thank you in advance for your time!
